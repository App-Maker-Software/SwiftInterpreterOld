# Swift Interpreter

A description of this package.

## Features

The Swift interpreter has automated tests which run against real compiled Swift. You can see those test results in the generated MD file called (TEST_RESULTS.md)[https://github.com/App-Maker-Software/SwiftInterpreter/blob/main/TEST_RESULTS.md].

Each time `run_tests.sh` is run while on the "staging" or "main" branch, this md `TEST_RESULTS.md` is automatically updated.
